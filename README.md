## Inspiration
The inspiration for this project was typing games and websites like MonkeyType.

## What it does
It gives individual lines of code and you have to copy the line properly within the time limit to get a point and continue.

## How we built it
I built the project using java, and the library Zircon for the GUI and UI/UX.

## Challenges we ran into
The libraries and tools I used all had minimal documentation for Java, making it difficult for me to implement code.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I got the project to work at all.
## What we learned
I got a better understanding of java and how to use libraries through Gradle and Maven.
## What's next for SyntaxMonkey
I might make it into a more fully fleshed project but I will for sure will use the tools I've used again.
